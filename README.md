# Fake-Review-Detection

# Problem Statement
Detection of fake reviews out of a massive collection of reviews having various distinct categories like Home and Office, Sports, etc. with each review having a corresponding rating, label i.e. CG(Computer Generated Review) and OR(Original Review generated by humans) and the review text.

Main task is to detect whether a given review is fraudulent or not. If it is computer generated, it is considered fake otherwise not.

# Description
Description: The generated fake reviews dataset, containing 20k fake reviews and 20k real product reviews. 
OR = Original reviews (presumably human created and authentic); 
CG = Computer-generated fake reviews.

# Performance Overview of ML Models Leveraged
Support Vector Machines Classifier performed the most accurate predictions regarding the fake nature of reviews having a predictive accuracy of just over 88%, closely followed by Logistic Regression which had a prediction accuracy of a little more than 86%. Random Forests Classifier and Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm predicted to a precision level of approximately 84%. However, the Decision Tree Classifier performed fake reviews prediction upto an accuracy of just over 73%. The worst performing algorithm was the K Nearest Neighbors algorithm which could only perform the predictions upto an accuracy level of nearly 58%.
